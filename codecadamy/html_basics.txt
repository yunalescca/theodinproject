* <!DOCTYPE html> : Let web browser know this is html document. Doesn't actually
add any structure to the rest of the document. To add the structure, we add:
<html></html>

* <head></head> : is the metadata for the document. Information about the web
page that isn't displayed.

* <h1>Josefin</h1> : HEADER 1

* <title></title> : can be put inside the <head> tag. When we open a new tab,
the name of the tab is the same text we put inside the <title> tag.

* <body></body> : In order for something to be displayed in a html page, we need
to declare the body. Inside the body we can write:
<p> text... </p> : which will be displayed as normal text. p is for paragraph.

* <br /> : One of the self-closing tags. This will cause linebreak. Cannot be
wrapped around raw text.

* <div></div> is something that web developers use to group together elements,
divide the HTML document into sections. Can apply CSS to many elements at once.

* Inside the <img> tag, we can add 'add ="..."' (without single quotes), which
will 1. describe the image in words when it fails to load and 2. It will read out
loud the text for those who are visually impaired and have a special tool
installed in their browser.

* Can also add a <video> Video not available </video> tag. Inside, we can add
<video src="..." height="..." width="..." controls> which will set height and
width, but also add basic controls for the video (play/pause).

* <a href="..."> This is a link to another page! </a>
* <a href="..." target="_blank"> This is a link to another page which will
open the link in a new tab! </a>

* <a href="./aboutme.html">About Me</a> links to a internal page
